    "The idea of ESG has been turning into a buzzword. Since 2016, United Nations started promoting __[SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2016/)__. And since 2017, the number of publications on this topic was almost doubling each year __[(Senadheera, Gregory, Rinklebe, Farrukh, Rhee & Yong, 2022)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/27658511.2022.2125869)__. The surge in ESG metrics and reporting fuels its landing from an idealistic concept to a reality that companies, consumers and governments need to embrace.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "However, the discussion around ESG is never one-sidely supportive. ESG is framed by some as profit speculation deviating from the goal of social conscience. __[(The Economist, 2022)](economist.com/leaders/2022/09/29/the-fundamental-contradiction-of-esg-is-being-laid-bare?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&utm_source=google&ppccampaignID=17210591673&ppcadID=&utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&gclid=CjwKCAiA3pugBhAwEiwAWFzwdVmFnWUx-DL54IAsbZAxHU02MsklhtHuaoPryzCKLJxguRTeUM9svxoCKOMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)__. And there are fierce arguments surrounding whether companies should compromise the traditional priority of maximizing the profit of shareholders. After starting as a niche corner of the finance world, ESG investing has since exploded to become a major force on Wall Street, and the latest front in the cultural schism __[(Associate Press, 2022)](https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2023-03-01/what-is-esg-investing-and-why-do-some-hate-it-so-much)__. Therefore, examining public feedback about ESG is significant for policymakers and world leaders in order to refine relative regulations and to build full-fledged guidelines. "

    "In order to perceive the public’s opinion on ESG, the project aims to collect Twitter users’ posts containing “ESG” replying to five large media outlet accounts, namely __[the New York Times](https://twitter.com/nytimes)__, __[the Wall Street Journal](https://twitter.com/WSJ)__, __[the Washington Post](https://twitter.com/washingtonpost)__, __[the Fox News](https://twitter.com/FoxNews)__ and __[the CNN Breaking News](https://twitter.com/cnnbrk)__ from **March 1 in 2022 to March 1 in 2023**. The data for collection is concentrated on people’s replies to media outlets because media outlets play a significant role to bridge the public and policymakers, and frequently arouses dense discussion on heated topics in the public sphere. Therefore, those posts replying to the media accounts could provide us with diverse and representative thoughts."

      "@WSJ It's obvious that these ESG funds are bogus.

We should hold accountable those companies who espouse principled business practices that promote individual liberty while assuming full responsibility for their actions.@FoxNews If Tesla isn’t a top 500 ESG company who is?@FoxNews Everyone will get helped Kamala if they qualify. She's not in charge of Florida, DeSantis is, he'll get reimbursed w/ his own local and state recovery costs.. Hands off.. will she make DeSantis have a ESG/Equity board like the rest of the fed agencies.. I don't think so.@FoxNews It's Staged. I thought she would be inside. Is her job now  to inspire more young people to become ESG revolutionaries.@WSJ Simple solution - don’t be an ESG investor. You are perpetuating a scam.@washingtonpost “industry shift” not a consumer shift in preferences. This is likely ESG driven.@WSJ Leftists support corporate Fascist control through ESG.@nytimes Lol no. They're trying to stop ESG from making our country a socialist shit hole.@FoxNews Is this the same BlackRock that made a fortune on ESG funds at the expense of proper use of fossil fuels so that we wouldn’t face energy shortages in the future?@washingtonpost Talk about not knowing your audience. Obviously this was a top down directive in order to boost the company's ESG score. Lol.@WSJ Esg is fucking scam@FoxNews @elonmusk S&amp;P explained why it kicked Tesla out of its ESG index earlier this month. Tesla's \"lack of a low-carbon strategy\" and \"codes of business conduct,\" along with racism and poor working conditions reported at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, affected the score.@nytimes That’s literally what the democrats and progressive republicans have been doing to anyone that doesn’t fall in line with ESG and the Great Reset 🙄.

We may be able to get the flock screaming and whining about ESG.@WSJ @WSJopinion Vanguard is part of the ESG propaganda and protocols. Black Rock as well. It’s ironic that they are the biggest shareholders of the railroad that is killing #Ohio. ESG is just about profits, power and propaganda.@nytimes The Biden/Fink ruling class is attacking energy supply and causing extreme inflation with ESG policy.   That is an irrefutable fact.@FoxNews The whole concept of \"ESG\" is nothing more than a leftists shakedown of corporations. \"Do as we say or we will destroy you\".@FoxNews They don’t. Not a single person attacking ESG actually understands its structure, they just oppose the principle of it because someone somewhere labeled it as “woke”.@washingtonpost Not one has any real estate development experience, but they all seem to love Governor Ron's need for campaign contributions.  This is a farce... and payback for ESG posturing by DISNEY.  The 5 \"tools\" just appointed to Reedy Creek probably don't realize the scrutiny they face.@nytimes Their leaders signed off on ESG and green new deal policies - it destroyed their farming and their economy - big surprise … https://t.co/yZgLCP4Z6Z@WSJ @WSJopinion It's nice they backed out of this ESG initiative, however they haven't stopped playing politics. \\n\\nAccording to their own articles, they are still wielding the power of $7 trillion in assets to influence climate change decisions.\\nhttps://t.co/GZaL6eRJrm\\n\\nhttps://t.co/PCQum5D3eP@WSJ spoke with @Taxeconomist\\nabout the great work @ALEC_states is doing protecting pensions from politically-motivated investing.\\nhttps://t.co/Gv8OGaTe5G@washingtonpost Till you do something THERE I don't want to see social credit scoring or ESG implemented HERE\\n\\nIf china, India, Russia, Iran, Japan aren't doing their part then you're making us suffer under the green thumb for nothing. https://t.co/pzdbqo99rj@WSJ ESG is a pseudonym for complete world domination. Basically.@washingtonpost Sounds like you want to implement ESG scores.@nytimes Thank god some group is doing what it takes to trash ESG@WSJ Good though nothing will probably come from it. ESG is toxic.@FoxNews Republicans “let the free market decide how people want to invest”\\n\\n*free market runs its course and some people are interested in esg*\\n\\n“We need to take these sorts of investment opportunities out of the market”@WSJ This is the way. ESG is a fraud &amp; violation of fund manager’s/director’s fiduciary duties to their investors, which is to maximize returns. Politicized investing harms our economy &amp; turns democracy on its head-trying to accomplish by proxy what you cannot by ballot. @Glenn_Hegar@FoxNews Who cares, ESG “scores” are pure evil.@washingtonpost “ESG conquers the automotive industry”@WSJ There’s nothing wrong with investing in ethical and praiseworthy companies. “ESG”measurements, gatekeepers, and enforcers however, should be avoided at all costs.@WSJ ESG has ruined everything@WSJ @WSJopinion Good because ESG is woke 🗑@WSJ Why just GS.

    "The discussion of ESG revolves around three themes: **financial investment, governance and scam**. It is observed that public discussion of ESG is often associated with **high-profile companies and public figures**, such as President Joe Biden, Tesla, and Black Rock, which is closely related to who is covered by the news media. In terms of sentiment, texts on Twitter are overall negative in sentiment, with both pro-ESG and skeptical of ESG using emotionally charged, negative language.<br><br>\n",
    "The data shows that public criticism of ESG focuses on five themes: \n",
    "<br>1) The ESG rating system is **not rewarding companies which are genuinely supporting environmental and social benefits**. <br>2) Many companies use ESG speculatively and deceptively in ways of such as **\"green-washing\"**. <br>3) ESG is **politicization of investing**, which allocates money based on political agendas. <br>4) pension trustees risk **violating their fiduciaries duties** if they permit their funds to engage in ESG investments because “the sole interest rule requires investment fiduciaries to act to maximize financial returns, not to promote social or political objectives” __[(Rubenfeld & Barr, 2022)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/esg-cant-square-with-fiduciary-duty-blackrock-vanguard-state-stree-the-big-three-violations-china-conflict-of-interest-investors-11662496552)__. <br>5) ESG investing creates a **disadvantage for industries like coal, oil, and natural gas**.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "To tackle problems including greenwashing and weaponization of ESG is to increase the transparency, which does not only **requires companies** to disclose information about pledges, targets and plans to let everyone see what they are doing, but also requires more transparency regarding **ESG rating procedure and standards** to allow people to easily access and understand how ESG value is applied to rate companies ."
