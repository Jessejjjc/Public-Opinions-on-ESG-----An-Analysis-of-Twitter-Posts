# Public-Opinions-on-ESG-----An-Analysis-of-Twitter-Posts

The idea of ESG has been turning into a buzzword exploded to become a major force on Wall Street. However, at the same time, it is also the latest front in a cultural schism where many administrations promote ESG and social responsible investing while some other politicians and anti-groups are chanting ESG as "woke-capitalism". This project is aimed to explore public opinion on the concept of ESG based on Twitter platform, to examine the contexts of people discussing ESG, peopleâ€™s sentiments when talking about ESG and key concerns or doubts people hold against ESG.
The project found that the discussion of ESG revolves around investment, governance and scam, and the public discussion is often associated with high-profile companies and public figures, such as President Joe Biden, Tesla, and Black Rock. In terms of sentiment, texts on Twitter are overall negative in sentiment, with both pro-ESG and skeptical of ESG using emotionally charged, negative language. Public's criticism of ESG focuses the failure of ESG rating metrics to reward companies that truly benefit environment or society, and deceptive use of ESG in ways like greenwashing.
